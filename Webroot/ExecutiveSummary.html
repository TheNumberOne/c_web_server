        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p><strong>Goals:</strong>
            To accommodate an expanding customer base and new service offerings, Wind Riders of the Lost River Range (WRLRR) seeks a renovated system that will improve functioning and efficiency thereof. Due to the recent management change in 2015, WRLRR is taking to new heights by seeking to provide more adventures for its customers such as pilot training and licensure, equipment rental, and even better service in the traditional realms of customers’ equipment purchases, returns, and maintenance. To allow new functionality to take flight, a new and improved system that both updates old processes and extends system functioning into the newly available service areas is needed. It is within the company’s best interest to implement this system to help keep its customers “soaring high”.

        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Problems: </strong>
            WRLRR needs to automate its systems to streamline customer support and to accommodate for new services. With the advent of the new system, the inventory management and equipment purchases will need to be updated to synergize with everyday functioning of the company. Currently, there is no service to that handles trainers and the information necessary to hire them. The early business model of using excel spreadsheets is outdated, and a new system with better recording accuracy and accessibility is required. The company’s past sales history is non-existent and needs to be implemented with the flight training service to ensure customer and trainer accuracy. The trainers themselves need a new system to accommodate the regulations and requirements for them to perform their duties.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Results: </strong>
            WRLRR’s improved system will update the inventory management and equipment purchases processes to better meet the needs of an expanding customer base. New modules will be added to provide the ability to track pilot training in agreement with regulations, as well as to manage the flight school insurance application process. Numerous reports required by business leadership will also be automated to improve tracking and forecasting. Daily operations will greatly improve with the implementation of these changes.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Recommendations: </strong>
            This system is highly recommended to improve the existing inventory management and equipment purchases processes, as well as to track and manage the new pilot training and insurance needs. By updating the system, the business will improve customer service, increase efficiency through the use of automated reporting, and increase sales by properly managing the new service offerings.
