            <strong>Company Background: </strong>
            Delighting adventure seekers from across the West since 1990, Wind Riders of the Lost River Range (WRLRR) is a specialty sports shop located in Central Idaho that has been providing wings for its customers to fly. Capitalizing on the booming free-flight sport equipment market which increased from $20,000 in 1990 to $2,300,000 in 2013, the company has continued to expand its offerings from equipment sales and servicing to providing a full flight school for budding and professional hang glider and paraglider pilots. After being purchased in 2015 by Nick Lovick, the company has continued to undergo changes as the new owner looks forward to the future, including discontinuing sales of ultralight aircraft. The new owner’s vision includes a variety of air training, adventure packages such as guided hikes and rafting trips, hot air balloon rides, and renting out wind riding equipment. At the time being, however, Nick is focused on developing excellent service delivery within the flight training component of the business, including overcoming the increasing challenges of meeting government and licensure requirements and safety regulations.

            <strong>Problems (that make a new system necessary)</strong>
            Business changes that have been made as the result of an evolving market and new business leadership have required alterations in the system to allow the new processes to function properly. These changes include:
            <ol>
                <li>With a growing number of sales and customers, the initial system struggled to maintain accurate inventory records. As a result, reorder points were missed, leading to stock-outs and lost sales. </li>
                <li>The early business days allowed the business to keep track of accounting via an off-the-shelf program, supplemented by Excel spreadsheets, but those days are no longer. With an increased sales volume, a more accurate and reliable system is needed </li>
                <li>Using the initial system, the company was not able to track their own sales history and trends, leaving the business in the dark for strategic purchases and promotional activities. </li>
                <li>The process for pilots to become certified requires strict record keeping and compliance with government regulations. The current system lacks the ability to capture or report this information</li>
            </ol>
