        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            The winds of change have brought WRLRR new ownership, new customers, new capabilities, and new revenue streams. The only way for these changes to be sustainable is if they are accompanied with new system abilities to track, process, record, report, and manage the new responsibilities. Otherwise, the business will continue to undergo the same pressure and strain that brought it to seek out system changes in the first place. Missed reorder points will continue, customers will come seeking products that are out of stock, purchasers will spend money on equipment that sits on the shelf, and pilots applying for a license will be shocked as they learn that their training sessions went undocumented. The proposed system will automate these processes, bringing the business leaders the capability they desire to earn profit while delighting their customers for years to come.
